<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This Project was my first time working with React, I made sure that I really understood the code. <br>
I learnt about Api usage, data manipulation, how to use Hooks in ReactJS, how to create your own custom ones too. <br>
It was challenging because it was a lot at once, but thanks to the slow introduction and the great guidance, it worked. <br><br>
It was a lot of fun and i really look forward for my next React Rroject <br>
